The objective of this project was to process and model Magnetic data to detect Alteration associated with Cu-Porphyry Mineralization. Firstly, Total Magnetic Map was provided through creating a database in Oasis Montaj Software. Then, filters were employed to get Residual Magnetic, Reduced to Pole, and Upward Continuation Maps. Results show that Mineralization has an NW-SE trend up to 100 m depth. To sharpen the boundaries of the ore body, Analytic Signal, Total Horizontal Derivative, Tilt Angle, and Theta Maps were created. Finally, Euler Depth Estimation and Analytic Signal-Euler Depth Estimation were provided to estimate the depth of extension. Anomaly source depth is between 65 to 80 meters. 3D models of volumes attributed to Magnetic Anomaly were drawn in ModelVision Software. Also, collected Gravity data were processed as above steps after producing Bouger and Residual Maps. Results show that the Potash mineralization has an NE-SW trend with extension to 25-35 m depth.
