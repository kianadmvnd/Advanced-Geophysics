The objective of this project was processing and modeling of Magnetic data to detect Alteration associated with Cu-Porphyry Mineralizationn. Firstly, Total Magnetic Map was provided through creating a database in Oasis Montaj Software.Then, filters were employed to get Residual Magnetic, Reduced to Pole and Upward Continuation Maps. Results show that Mineralization has a NW-SE trend up to 100 m depth. To sharpen the boundaries of ore body; Analytic Signal, Total Horizontal Derivative, Tilt Angle and Theta Maps were created.
Finally, to estimate depth of extention; Euler Depth Estimation and Analytic Signal-Euler Depth Estimation were provided. Anomaly source depth is between 65 to 80 meters. 3D model of volumes attributed to Magnetic Anomaly were drawn in ModelVision Software.
Also, collected Gravity data were processed as above steps after producing Bouger and Residual Maps. Results show that the Potash mineralization has a NE-SW trend with extention to 25-35 m depth.
